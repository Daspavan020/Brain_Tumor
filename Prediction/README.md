🧠 Brain Tumor Survival Prediction using DeepSurv (SurvivalNet)

This project trains a Deep Learning–based Survival Model (DeepSurv) to predict patient survival risk based on clinical and tumor metadata.  
It generates:

- 📊 A complete Excel results file with predictions & model metrics  
- 📄 A PDF report including loss curves, risk distribution, and Kaplan–Meier survival plots  
- 🎯 Risk categorization for each patient (High Risk vs Low Risk)  
- 🔁 Timestamped outputs generated every run

## 📌 Example Model Output

| Patient ID | Time | Event | Risk Score | Group |
| ---------- | ---- | ----- | ---------- | ----- |
| 1          | 320  | 1     | 0.47       | High  |
| 2          | 540  | 0     | -2.51      | Low   |
| ...        | ...  | ...   | ...        | ...   |

## 🔍 Evaluation Metric

* **C-Index (Concordance Index)**
  Measures how well the model predicts ranking.
  **1.0 = perfect prediction**

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

* SHAP-based Explainability
* Web Deployment with Streamlit
* Hyperparameter Tuning for Clinical Performance
* Multi-Model Comparison (CoxPH, XGBoost-Survival etc.)
